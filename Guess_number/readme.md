This is an exercise from my Java course where the users inputs a number between 1 to 100 and the player tries to guess the secret number.
When the user tries to guess the secret number, appears a clue saying if the number needs to be bigger or smaller. If the user guesses the number, a message appears, stating that the user won and how many tries it needed.
The user can also exit the game at any time, just needs to type "Off".
